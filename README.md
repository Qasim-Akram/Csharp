🚀 Advanced Programming – Windows App, Backend & API

This repository is a learning + development workspace for Advanced Programming concepts, starting with Windows Applications and gradually extending to Backend Development and RESTful APIs.

The goal of this repo is not just to build applications, but to understand architecture, clean code, and real-world software development practices.

📌 Repository Objectives

Learn Advanced Programming concepts through hands-on projects

Build Windows desktop applications using C# and .NET

Implement backend logic with proper architecture

Develop and expose RESTful APIs

Practice clean code, modular design, and scalability
